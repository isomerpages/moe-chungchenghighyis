NAPFA - Physical Fitness Test
-----------------------------

The NAPFA, which comprises of six test items, is administered to all medically fit students in schools. In our school, we have always emphasized to our students the importance of fitness and healthy life style.  

  

Students are to report punctually in the PE attire. They should also have enough rest and drink plenty of water on the night before the test.

  

Students who are on medical leave for that day will have to take the test on another day. Only students who are on long-term medical leave will be exempted from taking the test.
