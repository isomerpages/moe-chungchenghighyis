The core of the ICT framework is to empower our students to be future-ready and responsible digital learners. Through effective use of e-Pedagogy, students will be able to acquire digital skills across four components, 'Find, Think, Apply and Create _(adapted from National Digital Literacy Programme)_. This is complemented by professional development of teachers and supportive learning environment for everyone.  

## e-Pedagogy

e-Pedagogy is the practice of teaching with technology for active learning that creates a more participatory, connected and reflective classroom to nurture the future-ready learner. To enrich students' learning experiences, our teachers will apply e-Pedagogy into lessons that make use of the affordances of technology, namely Conceptual Change, Differentiation, Metacognition and Assessment for Learning.
