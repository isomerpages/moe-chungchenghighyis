### Mission

### ICT Framework

The core of the ICT framework is to empower our students to be future-ready and responsible digital learners. Through effective use of e-Pedagogy, students will be able to acquire digital skills across four components, 'Find, Think, Apply and Create _(adapted from National Digital Literacy Programme)_. This is complemented by professional development of teachers and supportive learning environment for everyone.  

### e-Pedagogy

e-Pedagogy is the practice of teaching with technology for active learning that creates a more participatory, connected and reflective classroom to nurture the future-ready learner. To enrich students' learning experiences, our teachers will apply e-Pedagogy into lessons that make use of the affordances of technology, namely Conceptual Change, Differentiation, Metacognition and Assessment for Learning.

### AL- Active Learning with Technology

| Affordances 	| Students’ Learning Outcome 	|
|---	|---	|
| **Conceptual Change** 	| Through multimodal representations of abstract concepts, students are able to discern critical features, patterns and infer generalisations 	|
| **Differentiation** 	| Giving students access to differentiated learning tasks at their own pace, readiness and interest 	|
| **Metacognition** 	| Automated support for students to make sense and regulate their learning<br>  	|
|  	| Students are guided by teachers to reflect and ask questions, regulate and monitor their learning.<br>  	|
| **Assessment for Learning** 	| Able to receive formative feedback about their level of understanding, learning processes and progress 	|


# **Cyber-wellness**

Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace. The focus of CW is about helping students to become responsible digital learners. 

### MOE's Cyber Wellness (CW) Education

MOE uses the CW framework to develop the child’s instinct to protect and empower him to take responsibility for his own well-being in cyberspace. The three principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ when adhered to will anchor a child’s well-being in cyberspace as he will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions.
