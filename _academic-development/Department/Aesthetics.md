The core of the framework includes:

• Core Values

• CCHY Teaching and Learning Framework

  

Through our Aesthetics Curriculum, we aim to develop in students:

1. Self-directedness and Joy of learning

2. 21st Thinking Skills and Disposition

  

Three behavioral learning domains encapsulate the cognitive, affective and psychomotor dimensions of students’ engagement in Aesthetics.

  

**Domain 1**: Perceiving and Listening&nbsp;

The ability to pay attention to and analyse what is around them. In perceiving and listening, students develop sensitivities that stimulate their imagination. They learn to gather, organise and record information, and use that information to generate and present their ideas in the various subject disciplines – Art, D&amp;T, Music and FCE

  

**Domain 2**: Creating and Communicating&nbsp;

Art, Music, D&amp;T and FCE communicates e.g. ideas, solutions, emotions, and concepts. By investigating and exploring problems and ideas, students discover creative ways to express themselves and/or develop feasible solutions. They learn to apply their understanding of various skills learnt in authentic learning tasks to express intent and achieve their purpose.

  

**Domain 3**: Connecting and Appreciating

Students learn to reflect and evaluate their own practices and develop the confidence to share their work with others. Through this process, they are able to make connections between their work and their own experiences.
