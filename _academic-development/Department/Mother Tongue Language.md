# **Mother Tongue Language**

## Vision

Every Student a Confident and Passionate Learner of Mother Tongue Languages and Cultures

Chung Cheng High School (Yishun) has remained steadfast over the years in the implementation of Mother Tongue Languages Programmes.  

The school was officially declared as the N2 Cluster Centre of Excellence for Chinese Language (COE CL) in 2008 by Ms Grace Fu, then Senior Minister of State for Ministry of National Development and Ministry of Education. Since then, the school has played an active role in promoting the teaching and learning of Chinese Language (CL), serving the Cluster’s CL teachers by facilitating professional development training through collaboration with agencies such as the Singapore Centre for Chinese Language (SCCL) and Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB).

After our relocation to Yishun in 2005, CCHY reaffirmed her commitment to serving the needs of the community by offering the Malay Language (ML). The dedicated and passionate teachers of the ML unit put in their best to nurture the students and achieve encouraging results in the National Examinations, despite a comparatively smaller cohort of students.

Working hand-in-hand, the CL and ML unit deliver comprehensive MTL programmes that are fully in-line with MOE’s stand of Bilingualism as a cornerstone of Singapore’s education system.

## Instructional Programmes

The MTL Department offers the following Instructional Programmes:

·         Normal (Technical): Basic Chinese Language N(T), Basic Malay Language N(T)

·         Normal (Academic): Chinese Language N(A), Malay Language N(A)

·         Express: Chinese Language, Higher Chinese Language, Malay Language, Higher Malay Language

·         _Students who offer Tamil Language will attend lessons in other schools within the vicinity that have been designated as Tamil Language Centres._

## Cross-Cultural Programme

The MTL Department also runs the Cross Culture Programme as part of the school’s effort to help students develop a deeper understanding of their own culture and the cultures of other ethnic groups. Students whose MTL is Chinese attends lessons in Chinese, while students who offer other MTLs attend the lessons in English.

我校跨文化课程由母语部华文组主理。该课程由《弟子规》旗舰课程拓展而成，除了教导学生《弟子规》的丰富内容也带领学生认识不同族群的文化习俗，培养他们对母族文化和其他不同文化的认识与尊重。跨文化课程以华语讲授，母语为非华文的学生则以英语上课，实现全校覆盖的全人教育理念。
