<center><b>2. What is visualisation?</b></center>

What do Olympic athletes think about right before they compete in front of an international audience watching their every move? Do they think about all the things that may go wrong and how to avoid them? No, well-trained athletes know that they _should never_ visualise mistakes.

Visualising mistakes or imagining poor performance increases the likelihood that it will actually happen during the event, even when it doesn’t mean to. The mind is able to hear the insecurities and will set in motion a series of events that might prove your fears right.

Instead, most top athletes are trained to visualize their goals right before a competition. They see themselves winning the game, running the fastest race, or scoring the winning point. They're trained to "picture" what they **want** to happen, instead of what they **don't** want to happen. When they do this, their chances for success increase dramatically.

This is the **power of visualization** and you can use this technique to help you achieve your goals. Visualization is a simple technique that you can use to create a strong mental image of a future event. With good use of visualization, you can practice in advance for the event, so that you can prepare properly for it. And by visualizing success, you can build the self-confidence you need to perform well.

This is in line with our framework of Positive Education where we focus on Positive emotions - what should go well for us instead of what will go wrong for us in any given situation.
