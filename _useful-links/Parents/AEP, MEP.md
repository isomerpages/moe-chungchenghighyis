The framework is based on the National Arts Education Award framework and Art, Music and D&T syllabuses to guide school to attain the mission, vision and values of Aesthetics department. In return, school will also develop and assess students learning and achievements in Aesthetics for a holistic secondary education. The framework for arts policy is structured under the three domains of Head, Heart and Hand. Through the three domains, students develop skillful and artful knowledge (Head) through different forms of media (such as painting, playing a musical instrument, etc) and achieved excellence (Hand). Through thinking and understanding the artists’ works of past and present (Art Appreciation) (Head) and through articulating their thoughts and feelings about their works and others works (Heart). The three domains are interconnected and operate dynamically. It also prepares our students to gain the knowledge, skills and values to thrive in a future driven by globalization and technological advancements, fulfilling the three domain of 21st Century Competencies (Civic Literacy, Global Awareness and Cross-Cultural Skills; Critical and Inventive Thinking; and Information and Communication skills).
