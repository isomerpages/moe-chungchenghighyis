**Direct School Admission–Secondary (DSA-Sec) Exercise for admission to Secondary One**

1.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme provides students with the opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school, based on a diverse range of specific academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the PSLE.

2.&nbsp; &nbsp; Application for DSA-Sec can be submitted through the online DSA-Sec Portal. The application is free-of-charge. For more details, please refer to MOE website –&nbsp;[www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec](www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec)

3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.

4.&nbsp; &nbsp; Students who are successfully admitted to the school via DSA are expected to honour their commitment to the school, and participate in the&nbsp; activities related to the talent they are selected for from year 1-4.
