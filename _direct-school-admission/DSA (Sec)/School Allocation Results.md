# **School Allocation Results**

**DSA-Sec Allocation Results Release**

DSA-Sec candidates studying in MOE mainstream schools will receive their DSA-Sec results together with their PSLE results through their primary schools.

Candidates not studying in MOE mainstream schools can collect their DSA-Sec results from MOE Customer Service Centre.

Successful&nbsp;DSA-Sec candidates who took PSLE are <u>NOT</u> allowed to participate in the S1 Posting Exercise. However, if they are eligible for third language and/or course options (e.g. Express/NA, NA/NT), they may exercise these options during the S1 Option Phase. 


Successful&nbsp;DSA-Sec candidates are <u>NOT</u> allowed to transfer to another school after the release of the PSLE results. They are expected to honour the commitment to the posted DSA schools for the duration of the programme admitted to.
