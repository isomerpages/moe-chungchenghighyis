# **School Allocation Results**

**DSA-Sec Allocation Results Release (late Nov 2024)**

DSA-Sec candidates studying in MOE mainstream schools will receive their DSA-Sec results together with their PSLE results through their primary schools.

Successful DSA-Sec candidates who took PSLE are <u>NOT</u> allowed to participate in the S1 Posting Exercise. However, if they are eligible for third language and/or Posting Group options, they may exercise these options during School Choice Submission period via the S1 Posting. 


Successful DSA-Sec candidates are <u>NOT</u> allowed to transfer to another school after the release of the PSLE results. They are expected to honour the commitment to the posted DSA schools for the duration of the programme admitted to.
