# **Application**

Application for DSA-Sec can be submitted through the online DSA-Sec Portal.&nbsp; The application is free-of-charge.  

Follow these steps to apply:

1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Log in to the DSA-Sec portal with your SingPass. Find out&nbsp;[how to register for a SingPass](https://www.singpass.gov.sg/singpass/common/supportmain)&nbsp;if you don't have one.

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can indicate up to 3 choices and 3 talent areas.

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may indicate up to 2 talent areas for the same secondary school. If you are keen to apply for 2 talent areas offered by the school, you must indicate both talent areas as separate choices.

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may provide information for up to 10 non-school based activities and achievements which are related to your child's chosen talent areas.

5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no need to submit any supporting documents during application. Your child's primary school records (for example, P5 academic results, CCA, school-based activities, achievements or awards) will be automatically shared with the schools.

6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter your contact details correctly. This allows the schools to contact you if your child is shortlisted for the selection process.

7.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you are unable to apply online, approach your child's primary school for assistance.
