# **Frequently Asked Questions**



**Are&nbsp;there&nbsp;any&nbsp;other&nbsp;documents&nbsp;that&nbsp;I&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;submit&nbsp;along with&nbsp;my&nbsp;online application via DSA-Sec portal?**    

No. Should you be shortlisted, you may share with us on your relevant experience during the interview. Having an elaborate portfolio is not necessary.

**I have received several DSA-Sec offers, when must I decide to accept one?**

You will have to indicate your preferences for up to 3 schools during the Exercise School Preference Stage.&nbsp; This will be conducted in end October.&nbsp; Applicants may submit their school preferences through the MOE online system, or by submitting the completed School Preference Form (in hardcopy) to their primary schools.

**Will relevant qualification (or certification) in Dance/Music/Sports be necessary?**

Yes.&nbsp;Relevant qualification and&nbsp;proof&nbsp;of&nbsp;achievements&nbsp;will be required in order to be shortlisted for our DSA selection process.
