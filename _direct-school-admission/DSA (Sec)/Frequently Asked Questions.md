# **Frequently Asked Questions**

### FAQs

**Are there any other documents that I need to submit along with my online application via DSA-Sec portal?**    

No. Should you be shortlisted, you may share with us on your relevant experience during the interview. Having an elaborate portfolio is not necessary.

**I have received several DSA-Sec offers, when must I decide to accept one?**

You will have to indicate your preferences for up to 3 schools during the Exercise School Preference Stage.  This will be conducted in end October.  Applicants may submit their school preferences through the MOE online system, or by submitting the completed School Preference Form (in hardcopy) to their primary schools.

**Will relevant qualification (or certification) in Dance/Music/Sports be necessary?**

Yes. Relevant qualification and proof of achievements will be required in order to be shortlisted for our DSA selection process.
