# **Exercise School Preference Stage**

**School Preference Submission (21 - 25 Oct 2024)**

Students who receive at least one DSA-Sec offer (including from SOTA) will receive email and SMS notification via Postman.gov.sg on the School Preference Submission in mid Oct 2024.

**Both parents are required to login to the DSA-Sec Portal using their Singpass to submit up to three school preferences.**  If parent(s) are unable to submit online, they can approach their child's primary school for assistance to submit the school preferences on their behalf.
