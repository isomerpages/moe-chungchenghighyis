CCHY Alumni Youth Wing (中正义顺咏青团) is an extended wing of the Alumni Group that was set up in Feb 2010 to promote the Chung Cheng Spirit. It is a voluntary group that consists of graduates under the age of 21 with the objective of providing a platform for graduates to show gratitude and contribute back to their alma mater school.

The annually elected Executive Committee pool all alumnus together to support school events. Events such as Camp Exhibeo and Homecoming allowed graduates to stay connected to their alma mater and mentor their juniors.
