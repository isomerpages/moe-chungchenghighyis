**CCHY-Rainbow Centre Yishun Park School (RCYPS) Satellite Partnership**

Our Partnership with RCYPS promotes social integration in making our society a more inclusive one. Through the many activities organised, such as the spreading of the joy of Chinese New Year by giving mandarin oranges to residents in the Yishun neighbourhood, Marina Bay Run, National Day Celebrations and Community Mural Painting, students from both school interact and understand each other better. Staff from RCYPS also share valuable insights with CCHY teachers to better equip them with strategies to engage special needs students.
