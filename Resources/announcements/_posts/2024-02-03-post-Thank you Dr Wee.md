<p>We are deeply saddened by the news of Our School Management Committee
Chairman, Dr Wee Cho Yaw’s passing.</p>
<p>Dr Wee Cho Yaw had dedicated his life to the betterment of education in
our school. Apart from generously giving in the areas of upgrading the
school’s learning facilities and resources to enhance holistic development
in our students, he also cared deeply about the well-being and professional
growth of our staff. As chairman, he oversaw and contributed immensely
to the transformation of Chung Cheng High School (Branch) to Chung Cheng
High School (Yishun) today.</p>
<p>On behalf of the school’s staff and students, we would like to express
our heartfelt condolences to Dr Wee’s family.</p>
<p>Thank you, Dr Wee, for all you have done for Chung Cheng. May you rest
in peace.</p>
