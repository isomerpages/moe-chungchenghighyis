# **Full Subject-Based Banding**

Chung Cheng High School (Yishun) is one of 30+ secondary schools which has implemented Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) with our incoming Secondary One cohort since 2023.

##### **Purpose of Full SBB**
Full SBB is part of MOE's ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.  Under Full SBB, the Express, N(A) and N(T) streams will be phased out.

##### **Mixed form classes with the provision of a common curriculum**
The 2024&nbsp;cohort of Secondary 1 students will be grouped in&nbsp;mixed form classes, comprising students from different courses of study. Mixed form classes present more opportunities for students to interact with other students taking different subject combinations, and with different strengths and interests.

In their mixed form classes, students will take a set of subjects at a common level, amounting to about one-third of curriculum time. This would allow students in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together in these subjects.

These subjects are:

*   Art
    
*   Character and Citizenship Education
    
*   Design and Technology
    
*   Food and Consumer Education
    
*   Music
    
*   Physical Education
    

Teachers will adopt a&nbsp;range of teaching approaches&nbsp;to meet the different learning needs and pace of their students in the same form class.

At the start of Secondary 1, students will offer&nbsp;English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, and Science&nbsp;determined by their PSLE Scores.&nbsp;&nbsp;Students who offer most subjects at G1 or G2 are eligible to&nbsp;offer these subjects at a&nbsp;more demanding level from the start of Secondary 1 if they have performed well in these subjects at the PSLE.

##### **Offering of Humanities subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary 2**

Currently, secondary school students can offer English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics and Science at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary One based on students’ PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each subject. Beyond the start of Secondary 1, students may also offer these subjects at a more demanding level based on their performance in secondary school.

Our school will also provide Secondary 2 students the opportunity to take Humanities subjects at a more demanding level, if they meet subject-specific criteria.

The criteria for taking Humanities at a more demanding level will be based on students’ aptitude for and interest in these subjects at Secondary 1. They should also possess positive attitude towards learning and strong commitment to offer the subject at a more demanding level.

##### **How do I know if my child is offered a more demanding level subject(s) for 2024?**

If your child is eligible, you will receive an option form&nbsp; stating the offered subject(s) on Parents Gateway (PG) by&nbsp;Friday, 22&nbsp;December 2023.

##### **If my child is offered&nbsp;&nbsp;a more demanding level subject(s)&nbsp;for 2024, how do I submit my reply?**

For eligible students, please submit your response on Parents Gateway (PG) by&nbsp;Wednesday, 27 December 2023.
