Eligible Singapore Citizens (SCs) in financial need can get assistance from MOE on school fees and other expenses by applying for the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS).<br>

##### **How to apply**<br>
You can download the [MOE FAS application form](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/-/media/2a3bf498a09a4e7b9088d1a60f761c67.ashx) &nbsp;or collect a copy at your childâ€™s school. Submit the completed form with all relevant documents directly to the school.

If you have children in different government or government-aided schools, you can submit ONE application form to any of their schools. The school that receives the application form will inform you of the outcome.
