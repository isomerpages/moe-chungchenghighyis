# **Full Subject-Based Banding**

Chung Cheng High School (Yishun) is one of 30+ secondary schools which has implemented Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) with our incoming Secondary One cohort since 2023.

##### **Purpose of Full SBB**
Full SBB is part of MOE's ongoing efforts to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to the different strengths and interests of our students.  Under Full SBB, the Express, N(A) and N(T) streams will be phased out.

##### **Mixed form classes with the provision of a common curriculum**
The 2024&nbsp;cohort of Secondary 1 students will be grouped in&nbsp;mixed form classes, comprising students from different courses of study. Mixed form classes present more opportunities for students to interact with other students taking different subject combinations, and with different strengths and interests.

In their mixed form classes, students will take a set of subjects at a common level, amounting to about one-third of curriculum time. This would allow students in mixed form classes to spend curriculum time together in these subjects.

These subjects are:

*   Art
    
*   Character and Citizenship Education
    
*   Design and Technology
    
*   Food and Consumer Education
    
*   Music
    
*   Physical Education
    

Teachers will adopt a&nbsp;range of teaching approaches&nbsp;to meet the different learning needs and pace of their students in the same form class.

At the start of Secondary 1, students will offer&nbsp;English Language, Mother Tongue Languages, Mathematics, and Science&nbsp;determined by their PSLE Scores.&nbsp;&nbsp;Students who offer most subjects at G1 or G2 are eligible to&nbsp;offer these subjects at a&nbsp;more demanding level from the start of Secondary 1 if they have performed well in these subjects at the PSLE.
