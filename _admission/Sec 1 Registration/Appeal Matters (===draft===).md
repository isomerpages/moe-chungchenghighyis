School admissions are based on merit in the Secondary 1 Posting Exercise. Posting decisions are based on the objective and transparent measures of academic merit i.e. PSLE scores.

Appeals that take place after the S1 Posting Exercise must be aligned to these principles, in order to be fair to other admitted students.

##### **Appeal in to CCHY (non-medical reasons)**<br>
Primary 6 students who have applied to Chung Cheng High School (Yishun) during MOE’s Secondary 1 Posting Exercise but are unsuccessful, may appeal to be considered for transfer to Chung Cheng High School (Yishun).

These students, appealing for admission to CCHY after the release of the Secondary 1 Posting Results, have to meet the school’s cut-off point.

Students who do not meet the cut-off point would not be eligible to appeal for admission.&nbsp;

For parents/guardians who would like to transfer your child to Chung Cheng High School (Yishun), please complete the [School Transfer Application Form](https://form.gov.sg/63a25475cf15ee0012a54d26) . All applications are subjected to review and assessment by the School.&nbsp;

##### **Appeal in to CCHY (due to medical reasons)**<br>
