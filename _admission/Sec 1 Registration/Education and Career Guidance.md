Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is a holistic and experiential effort aimed at equipping your child with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed education and career decisions. Education &amp; Career Guidance is a journey and not a point. Your child ECG journey starts from Sec One till they graduate from CCHY.
