# **Parents Gateway**

Dear Parents/Guardians,

**Invitation to Parents Gateway**

We are pleased to inform you that our school is now onboard Parents Gateway. Parents Gateway is a mobile app specially designed for parents. Developed by MOE and GovTech, the app allows parents to engage with schools, receive information and perform a range of administrative functions such as giving consent for school trips

We would like to invite you to download the Parents Gateway mobile app on your mobile phone (available on iOS and Android platforms only) and perform a simple one-time onboarding process. Please refer to&nbsp;**Annex A**&nbsp;**(below)**&nbsp;for a step-by-step guide.

From May 2019, parents who are onboard Parents Gateway will receive announcements and consent forms via the mobile app. The school will continue to issue letters via email to parents who are unable to come onboard Parents Gateway.

We look forward to your support. Thank you.
