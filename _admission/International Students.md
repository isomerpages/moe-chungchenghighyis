### International Students Admissions

International students who wish to seek admission to mainstream schools are required to sit for and pass the Admissions Exercise for International Students (AEIS) administered by the Ministry of Education.  

Admission is not guaranteed, and is subject to the applicant’s performance in the centralised test and available school vacancies.

Successful applicants will not be allowed to choose their school, and requests for school transfers will not be entertained.
