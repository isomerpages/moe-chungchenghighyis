Our Entrepreneur Club offers students a unique opportunity to learn about entrepreneurship as well as develop their technological skills, such as coding. By collaborating in teams, our students are able to exercise their creativity, able to build leadership skills and learn to create innovative products that are sold during events like Teacher’s Day and Be Your Own Boss Day.
