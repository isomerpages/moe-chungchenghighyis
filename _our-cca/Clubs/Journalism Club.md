You may encounter a team of students diligently taking notes, interviewing people and taking photographs during Chinese New Year celebrations, the Chung Cheng Championships, Learning Beyond Classroom Week, National Day Parades and other various school events and occasions.&nbsp;

These are our enthusiastic student journalists covering events and school achievements; and eventually delivering well-written articles and impactful photos to promote school pride and belonging! We aim to improve our journalists’ writing, interviewing and photography skills through various in-house training sessions and collaborations with other CCAs.

### Mission
To nurture student journalists to become creative writers, inspiring interviewers and impactful photographers so as to promote a sense of school pride and belonging.

### Vision
To provide a conducive environment that culminates in excellent writing, interviewing and photography skills for life.
