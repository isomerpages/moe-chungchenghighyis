# **CCA**

怀着追求卓越、止于至善的信念，中正中学（义顺）无论在学术成绩，还是品德教育方面，都以展翅高飞之势，取得令人雀跃的发展。我们竭尽所能帮助孩子争取最高成就，并且和他们一起做好准备，面对充满挑战的未来！

CCHY has constantly been attaining laudable results for both academic and CCA domains. These results serve as testaments of the institute's ability to nurture our students holistically. Our students are aptly prepared to receive post-secondary education upon graduation from CCHY.

### Compulsory CCA Participation

CCA is an integral part of the student’s holistic education in school. Hence, CCA participation is compulsory at the secondary school level, and every student is expected to participate in a CCA from one of the four CCA groups, namely, Clubs, Physical Sports, Uniformed Groups (UG) and Visual & Performing Arts (VPA).  Participation in a school-based CCA allows the teachers to guide and chart the development of the student beyond the learning from the subject disciplines in the classroom, in areas such as leadership and character development, and the 21st Century Competencies (21CC).

### Sec 1 CCA Experience

**1. Objectives**  
a) To allow Secondary 1 students to explore their interest in Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) and make an informed choice

b) To involve CCA leaders (Upper Secondary students) in the selection of CCA members via auditions, selection trials, and interviews

**2. Duration**   
It is compulsory for every student to be involved in a school-based CCA, taking up about 6 hours per week. Students have about 2 weeks in January to decide which CCA they are keen to participate in.

**3. Content of Programme**  
The following activities will be conducted throughout the month of January:

*   **CCA Carnival** on the Friday of Term 1 Week 1 and includes,       

*   Students visiting CCA booths and signing up for auditions, selection trials or/and interviews

*   Students attending scheduled auditions, selection trials and interviews during Term 1 Week 2 & 3  
    

  

**3.1 CCA Carnival**   
CCA Open House will be held on Friday of Term 1 Week 1.

CCA booths will be set up in Indoor Sports Courts, MPH, MPR, and the Parade Square.  Upper Secondary CCA leaders will be tasked to promote or pitch their CCAs to the Sec 1 students. As they share more information to new students, they will encourage them to register for the CCA and attend the auditions or selections held over the next 2 weeks.  

**3.2 CCA Selection Process**   
Students may choose to go for auditions, selection trials and interviews conducted by the various CCAs. The schedule of the selection events, held during Term 1 Week 2 to 3, will be published on our school website. 

Students are strongly advised to be selected for only ONE CCA (~6 hours a week).

Sec 1 students will also be required to indicate their Top 3 choices of CCA via FormSG (see Table 1). In the unfortunate event, where any student is not selected by any CCA trials, his or her inputs of Top 3 CCA choices (via FormSG) will be considered for the allocation of his/her CCA. However, the allocation will be based on the CCA vacancies available.

The complete CCA selection process is illustrated in Figure 1 below.

**4. CCAs in Chung Cheng High School (Yishun)**
