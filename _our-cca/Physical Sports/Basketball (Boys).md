# **Basketball (Boys)**

The CCHY Basketball Team focuses on developing sportsmen of resilient character and disciplined behaviour. Players undergo a rigorous and demanding training programme to grow the limits of their physical, mental, and social abilities. To this end, our training sessions comprise a series of fitness, skill-related drills, and set play practices. The team strives to continuously improve themselves, not just as an athlete, but also as a CCHY student.
