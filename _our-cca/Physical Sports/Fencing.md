CCHY Fencing is made up of a Team who is passionate about our sport. Under the dedicated guidance of our coaches and teachers, we take part in numerous competitions throughout the Fencing season. The team has been achieving good results consistently in each championship and we are always striving to outdo ourselves with each coming year.

Fencing requires one to be alert at all times, with the skills and ability to think quickly at any given situation. Fencers also need to be equipped with the ability to think calmly in any situation, which is indeed an essential skill in everyone’s live. Training has definitely given us a chance to push ourselves both physically and mentally. From our trainings, not only did we learn more about Fencing, we also pick up lessons that are useful for life, such as perseverance, coping with failure and teamwork.
