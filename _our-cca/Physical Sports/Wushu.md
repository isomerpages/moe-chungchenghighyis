Wushu (武术) is a traditional Chinese martial art that focuses on the cultivation of both physical and mental health. It mainly takes the form of routine exercises and free sparring. 

The practice of wushu can have a wide range of benefits for students. Physically, it can help improve fitness, strength, coordination, and balance. Mentally, it can help develop important character traits such as discipline, perseverance, and respect. Wushu can also be a fun and engaging way for students to learn about Chinese culture and history.

Students who practice wushu will learn a variety of forms, which are choreographed sequences of movements that are designed to showcase the beauty and power of the martial art. These forms can be performed individually or as part of a group, and they can provide a fun and rewarding way for students to showcase their skills and talents.

With its emphasis on self-defense, meditation, and performance, wushu can provide a well-rounded experience that can benefit students both in and out of the classroom.
