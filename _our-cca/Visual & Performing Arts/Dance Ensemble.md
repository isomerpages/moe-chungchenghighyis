# **Dance Ensemble**

![](/images/Our%20CCA/Dance_Ensemble.jpg)


Dance Ensemble is an amalgam of rhythm, power, elegance, and beauty. We strive to spark the blossoming of dancers into confident individuals with growing knowledge and passion for dance.

Through events such as Chingay and the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation, students have challenged themselves to choreograph and perform elements of contemporary dance, ballet, and local interpretations of traditional dance moves. This growing repertoire has enhanced their ability to express a myriad of emotions required for various themes.&nbsp;

**Teamwork** is the key to **excellence** and **discipline** in our CCA. Dancers learn to leverage on their different strengths while empathising and collaborating to ensure that success happens as a team.

We are the Dancers, We create the Dreams.

动与静， 柔与刚， 力与美 的结合。国际舞蹈团融合了各种舞蹈风格，体现舞蹈无界限的精神。我们是舞者，我们是梦的创造者！
