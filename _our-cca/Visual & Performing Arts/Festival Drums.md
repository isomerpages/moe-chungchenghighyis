中正中学（义顺）节令鼓队，从 1996年成立至今，已经十多年了。在过去的十多年里，中正节令鼓队的校内及校外的表演，已经超过了 180 次， 其中的 140 次是校外及国外的演出。 看过他们表演的人，真是数以万计，好评如潮。

多年来，我校节令鼓队除了在国内的各类大型场合表演以外，并先后到过马来西亚的新山、中国的上海、北京，及日本的静冈和千叶县表演，获得当地观众、学者及有关人士的高度评价。在校方的大力支持下，鼓队将继续努力，使节令鼓成为具有区域特色的表演艺术。

Chung Cheng High School (Yishun) Festival Drums Group, in short CCHY Festival Drums Group, is founded on 26th May 1996. Since then, we had performed in China, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore, gaining recognition from both local and international organizations. We had performed more than 140 public performances in the past years.

In 2006, CCHY Festival Drums Group made some very remarkable performances. They went on an immersion trip to China (Shanghai and Beijing); and performed for the first time in the world at the Beijing Drum Tower, a 700 years old building.

With the unstinting support from our Principal and School Management, CCHY Festival Drums Group will continue to put up high quality performances for the public and local community so as to bring fame and better recognition for the school in the coming years.

### About the Drums

Festival Drums group is special as it represents the 24 "Jieling (Sub-sessions)". The drums have their special meaning as well; the red, black and yellow symbolise auspiciousness and passion, perseverance, the Chinese culture and tradition respectively.

Our Group is unique in that our performing style is based on the combination of the Wushu (Chinese Martial Arts), calligraphy and dance. The Festival Drum Group is not only a performing group but a CCA group that emphasizes a lot on discipline, character building and teamwork as well as a well-balanced and happy life. A positive attitude on the part of the members is essential for learning and character building.
