# **Chinese Dance**

![](/images/Chinese%20Dance.jpg)

Chinese Dance is made up of aspiring and motivated dancers who all share the same passion for their craft. Our weekly practices see a fusion of ballet, Chinese ethnic dance and contemporary dance moves.

In the recent Singapore Youth Festival (SYF), the students did our school proud by winning the Distinction award through sheer hard work and determination. Apart from national competitions, the Chinese Dance group also actively takes part in school performances and community public performances every year.
