Choral music is a rich depository of human cultures. Through singing and understanding the contexts of the music, choir members learn to understand the world through perspectives of different people and identities. Through choral music, choir members experience inter-dependence in making musical harmonies. Through the pursuit of choral excellence, choir members learn to develop personal effectiveness and independence; interpersonal and collaborative skills through leading others and connecting with other choirs; a sense of performance – guided by a strong sense of community building, courage to change and a mindset of excellence.
