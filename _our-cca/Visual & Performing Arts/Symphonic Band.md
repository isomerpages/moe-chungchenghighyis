# **Symphonic Band**

*Our Symphonic Band aims to develop an enduring understanding and appreciation of the diverse local and global musical cultures in our members. They engage in a range of repertoire to expand their musical experiences. In the pursuit of musical excellence, our members develop resilience and confidence.* 

*Other than having performances, they gain the opportunity to develop their leadership qualities as they attend leadership courses organized by the Wind Bands Association of Singapore. Frequent exchanges with fellow schools have also encouraged members to step out of their comfort zone, and be willing to learn from bandsmen from other schools, potentially using what they have learnt in their daily lives, hoping to improve the band as a unit.*

*Our motto : “ One Band One Sound “*

*Together as a band, we strive to support one another and improve as a unit. We strongly believe in servant leadership and the only time we know we are successful in leading our batch, is when other members succeed under our care.*
