# **National Police Cadet Corps**

![](/images/NPCC.jpg)
NPCC is an organisation that firmly believes in development of character, leadership and resilience. Training has evolved from just drills to more structured and interesting training programmes. Through a myriad of activities, values such as discipline, loyalty, integrity, resourcefulness, tenacity and civic-consciousness are inculcated to develop members into Caring and Responsible Citizens.  

Our cadets are exposed to the unique opportunities to gain exposure and familiarity with Singapore’s crime prevention efforts to build a Safe and Secure Home.

### Teachers-in-charge
