# **National Police Cadet Corps**

NPCC allows cadets to learn and grow significantly in their personal competencies and leadership. Through a variety of activities, the values of Resilience, Integrity, Service and Excellence are inculcated in our students. These values, tying closely to our school’s values, will enable them to develop into caring and responsible citizens with a sense of purpose to serve the community.  

Our close affiliation to the Singapore Police Force exposes our cadets to unique opportunities to gain knowledge and familiarity with Singapore’ crime prevention efforts in building a safe and secure home for us all.
