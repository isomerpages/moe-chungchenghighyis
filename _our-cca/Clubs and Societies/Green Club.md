### The ‘Big Family’ Project in collaboration with Youth Corps Singapore & Ground-Up Initiative (GUI) @ ORTO
One may assume that a group of teenagers would not have much to contribute to the building of a playground, but they could not be more wrong. Over a span of four sessions during May and June, Chung Cheng High Yishun students helped in the creation of a playground located at ORTO from scratch. The playground, a life sized replica of the ever popular board game 'Snakes and Ladders', consists of wooden tiles which were painstakingly crafted by students and tires painted by students, as well as a recycled slide from an old playground. Students picked up useful life skills such as carpentry, digging, and mostly importantly of all working with others. It was an excellent learning opportunity and they all had great fun.
