# **LEAPS 2.0**

LEAPS 2.0 recognises students’ experiential learning and attainment in the four domains of the co-curriculum as they progress through their secondary school years. At the end of the graduating year, students’ co-curricular attainment will be recognised. This recognition will be translated to bonus point(s) which can be used for admission to Junior Colleges/Polytechnics/ Institutes of Technical Education (JC/Poly/ITE).

For an <u>Excellent</u> co-curricular attainment, which is translated to <u>two bonus points</u>, the student should have attained a minimum Level 3 in all four domains with at least Level 4 in one domain.

For a <u>Good</u> co-curricular attainment, which is translated to <u>one bonus point</u>, the student should have attained a minimum Level 1, in all four domains with any one of the following:

i. At least Level 2 in three domains;

ii. At least Level 2 in one domain and at least Level 3 in another domain; or

iii. At least Level 4 in one domain.

A <u>Fair</u> co-curricular attainment will not translate into any bonus points as the student has not met the minimum criteria for a Good co-curricular attainment.
