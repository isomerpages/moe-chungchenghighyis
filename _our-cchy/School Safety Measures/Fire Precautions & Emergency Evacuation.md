Fire Precautions & Emergency Evacuation
=======================================

Whoever is the first to notice the fire/emergency will inform the Principal/Vice Principal/HODs. Immediate steps will be taken to call the Fire Brigade (Tel No: 995) and activate the fire drill/SOP evacuation plans.

  

  

**Signals**
*   The school bell/hand bell will ring continuously for about 1 minute.
*   Students are advised to be calm. Walk swiftly and assemble in an orderly manner. Do not panic or talk.

**Actions to be taken by students**  
**In class**

*   Stop work immediately.
*   Switch off all fans and lights.
*   Move out in twos and assemble in the school field.

**At the assembly area**

*   Maintain silence at the assembly area.
*   Listen to instructions from teachers.
*   Monitors will assist teachers in taking attendance.


**Additional Points to note**

*   The direction of movement during evacuation depends on the location of danger. The staff and students should be familiar with alternative exits or evacuation routes. Should a specific staircase be shut off or rendered unsafe for use due to smoke or fire, alternative routes should be used.
*   All students should respond to the warning signal and leave the premises when the fire alarm is sounded.
*   The administrative staff and departmental assistants will ensure that class registers and all important documents are removed from the office/laboratories.
