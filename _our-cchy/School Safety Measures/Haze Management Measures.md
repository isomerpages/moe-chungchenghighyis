Haze Management Measures
========================

The Ministry of Education (MOE) and schools have in place a school continuity plan to ensure the well-being of our students and staff during a haze situation. The Ministry and schools are ready to respond and take appropriate haze management measures based on the MOH health advisory ([www.moh.gov.sg/haze](http://www.moh.gov.sg/haze)) corresponding to the air quality ([www.haze.gov.sg](http://www.haze.gov.sg/)).  

  

The well-being of all students remains a key priority. Teachers will be on the lookout for students who are unwell and students with pre-existing lung or heart conditions.

  

As children respond differently to haze, parents should ensure their children have their medication, such as inhalers for asthma, with them. Parents should also take their children to seek medical attention if they are unwell and ensure that their children take their medication to school or arrange for alternative care arrangements to care for them at home.

**CONTINUITY PLAN FOR PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOLS (INCLUDING MOE KINDERGARTENS AND VOLUNTARY WELFARE ORGANISATION (VWO)-RUN SPECIAL EDUCATION (SPED) SCHOOLS)**

Schools have in place a set of haze management plans and are ready to implement the appropriate haze management measures as required. A broad overview is provided below:

| **24-hour Pollutant Standards Index (PSI)<br>Forecast** 	| **School Management Measures** 	|
|---	|---	|
| ≤100<br>(Good/Moderate) 	| Continue with normal activities* 	|
| 101-200<br>(Unhealthy) 	     | • Schools will minimise prolonged or strenuous outdoor physical exertion.<br><br>• Students with pre-existing lung or heart conditions or are unwell will be exempted from all prolonged or strenuous outdoor physical exertion.<br><br>• Students and staff who are unwell will be temporarily accommodated in an air-conditioned room with an air purifier, before they are taken to seek medical attention. Parents of these students will also be notified. 	|
| 201-300<br>(Very Unhealthy) 	| • Schools will minimise outdoor activities.<br><br>• Students with pre-existing lung or heart conditions or are unwell would be exempted from all outdoor activities.<br><br>• Students, including those with pre-existing lung or heart conditions, will be in an enclosed indoor space with air purifiers** deployed.<br><br>• Students and staff who are unwell will be temporarily accommodated in an air-conditioned room with an air purifier, before they are taken to seek medical attention. Parents of these students will also be notified. 	|
| > 300<br>(Hazardous) 	| If PSI reaches 'Hazardous' level during school hours:<br><br>• Schools will avoid outdoor activities and scale down lessons.<br><br>• Students, including those with pre-existing lung or heart conditions, will be in an enclosed indoor space with air purifiers deployed.<br><br>• Students and staff who are unwell will be temporarily accommodated in an air-conditioned room with an air purifier, before they are taken to seek medical attention. Parents of these students will also be notified. 	|

*While the health advisory provides general precautionary advice, each individual's reaction to pollutants may vary. The amount of physical activity or exertion that can be performed also differs according to an individual's health status or capacity. Persons who are feeling unwell, especially the elderly and children, and those with chronic lung or heart conditions, are advised to seek medical care.

**All school classrooms are deployed with air purifiers to further enhance the well-being of our students and staff and better protect them from the effects of haze.
