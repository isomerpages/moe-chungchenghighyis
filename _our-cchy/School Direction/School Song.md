# **校歌 School Song**

<p><center>
Overlooking the eastern shore of Singapore,
	
Gallantly stands the magnificent Chung Cheng of ours.   
Spreading far and wide our cultural heritage and traditions,  
Enriching it with the best of all great civilizations,   
By this, we fulfil our mission.   
With enthusiasm and perseverance we strive   
To achieve moral virtues and excellence.   
With new knowledge and wisdom we seek   
To constantly reinforce our confidence.   
To be the best we can be,   
Our success and glory we share   
With people of all countries.    
To eternity we perpetuate   
The aspirations of our magnificent Chung Cheng,   
Far beyond all boundaries.</center></p>
