# **校歌 School Song**

<p></p><center>
Overlooking the eastern shore of Singapore,<br>
Gallantly stands the magnificent Chung Cheng of ours.<br>   
Spreading far and wide our cultural heritage and traditions,<br>  
Enriching it with the best of all great civilizations,<br>
By this, we fulfil our mission.<br>
With enthusiasm and perseverance we strive<br>
To achieve moral virtues and excellence.<br>
With new knowledge and wisdom we seek<br>   
To constantly reinforce our confidence.<br>   
To be the best we can be,<br>
Our success and glory we share<br>   
With people of all countries.<br>
To eternity we perpetuate<br>
The aspirations of our magnificent Chung Cheng,<br>
Far beyond all boundaries.</center><p></p>
