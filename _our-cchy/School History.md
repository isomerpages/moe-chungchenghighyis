Chung Cheng High School was established in January 1939 at Kim Yam Road, Singapore. In its early years, the school, with only male pupil enrolment, attracted students from ASEAN countries. It ceased operation during the Japanese Occupation.  After the Second World War, the school resumed operation as a co-educational school in September 1945.

In August 1947, to cope with the increased student population, part of the school moved into a new school building in Goodman Road. The school located at Goodman Road is named as **Chung Cheng High School (Main)** while the old school at Kim Yam road was renamed **Chung Cheng High School (Branch)** and subsequently in May 1969 it was relocated to Guillemard Road.

In 1981, following Singapore's emphasis on bilingualism, the school started offering English stream classes. Currently, the school offers secondary education courses in the Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal (Technical) streams for pupils.

In the late 90s, there was an urgent need to upgrade the school facilities and move to a more spacious location. In January 2003, in preparation for its move to Yishun, Chung Cheng High School (Branch) started to operate at two campuses, namely at the current Guillemard site and the holding school at Sembawang Drive. In 2005, when the new building was finally ready for use at its present location in Yishun, Chung Cheng High School (Branch) was renamed **Chung Cheng High School (Yishun)**.

  

On 30 June 2006, the school held its opening ceremony at the new site.
