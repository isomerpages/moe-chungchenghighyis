==================

Chung Cheng Spirit is a spirit that developed from the love for the school. Students must love and have a strong affection for Chung Cheng so that the spirit that developed through that can be uniquely called Chung Cheng Spirit. Chung Cheng Spirit is our identity, an identity that all students are proud of which bonds everybody together to do their best to uphold the school’s reputation and promote the school values. Students should exhibit Chung Cheng Spirit in all areas of their lives like striving for excellence in their studies and CCA, doing their best for the interest of the school, actively participating and supporting school events, contributing to the school and eventually society and their alma mater even after graduation.
