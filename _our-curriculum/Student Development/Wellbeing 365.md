<p>It is normal in today’s world for you to face challenges and a sense of
    helplessness. Cultivating the right mindset and good habits and tapping
    on the right strategies can help you to combat stress and preserve a positive
    well-being.</p>

<p><strong>2. What is visualisation?</strong>
</p>
<p>What do Olympic athletes think about right before they compete in front
    of an international audience watching their every move? Do they think about
    all the things that may go wrong and how to avoid them? No, well-trained
    athletes know that they&nbsp;<em>should never</em>&nbsp;visualise mistakes.</p>
<p>Visualising mistakes or imagining poor performance increases the likelihood
    that it will actually happen during the event, even when it doesn’t mean
    to. The mind is able to hear the insecurities and will set in motion a
    series of events that might prove your fears right.</p>
<p>Instead, most top athletes are trained to visualize their goals right
    before a competition. They see themselves winning the game, running the
    fastest race, or scoring the winning point. They're trained to "picture"
    what they&nbsp;<strong>want</strong>&nbsp;to happen, instead of what they&nbsp;<strong>don't</strong>&nbsp;want
    to happen. When they do this, their chances for success increase dramatically.</p>
<p>This is the&nbsp;<strong>power of visualization</strong>&nbsp;and you
    can use this technique to help you achieve your goals.&nbsp;Visualization
    is a simple technique that you can use to create&nbsp;a strong mental image
    of a future event. With good use of visualization, you can practice in
    advance for the event, so that you can prepare properly for it. And by
    visualizing success, you can build the self-confidence you need to perform
    well.</p>
<p>This is in line with our framework of Positive Education where we focus
    on Positive emotions - what should go well for us instead of what will
    go wrong for us in any given situation.</p>

    when her family was faced with a dire situation. &nbsp;She used visualisations
    to overcome odds.</p>
