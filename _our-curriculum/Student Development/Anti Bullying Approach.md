<h1><strong>Anti-Bullying Approach</strong></h1>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bullying
is a type of hurtful behaviour. It involves repeated or persistent behaviour
(e.g. hurting, frightening or intimidating others) intended to cause hurt,
distress or humiliation. It can be physical, verbal, psychological, social
or cyber in nature.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CCHY
maintains a zero-tolerance approach to bullying in all its forms. &nbsp;&nbsp;We
take all reported cases seriously and will work closely with the students
and parents of all parties to seek a resolution that is restorative to
the social and emotional development of our students. We seek your understanding
to give the school time in all cases pertaining to bullying and we will
communicate to the relevant parties in accordance with our communication
guidelines.

<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students
and parents may report bullying directly to any teacher, counsellor, or
school leader via the school’s email or phone number.</p>
