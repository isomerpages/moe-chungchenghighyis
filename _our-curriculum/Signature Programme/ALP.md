## Young Scientist Programme

**Aims**

Selected students in the Young Scientist Programme are given the opportunity to carry out investigative scientific or engineering projects under the guidance of mentors from external tertiary institutions through attachment to these institute of higher learning.

The programme aims to engage students in authentic scientific problem solving through hands-on experimentation and independent scientific thinking. Through cooperative teamwork, it allows students to organise their ideas into an investigative research project. This will allow them to recognise that science and engineering can contribute to meeting many of the major challenges that confront society today and to inspire them to take up careers in Scientific Research, Engineering and Technology in future. Selected student groups will also participate in competitions such as Science Research Competitions to broaden their learning and deepen their scientific research skills and knowledge through interactions with mentors and like-minded peers. 

The programme also aims to develop students in areas of Science which they are strongly interested in. Teacher mentors will coach the students and prepare them for external competitions such as National Science Challenge, Junior Olympiads.

**Science Ambassador Programme**

Selected students in the Science Ambassador Programme have the opportunities to

1. To enjoy and value Science, with a strong desire to use essential features (question -> evidence -> explain -> connect -> question) of Science as a tool to explore natural and physical world.

2.  To promote the learning of Science to the students population beyond the classroom.

3.  To encourage the development of effective communication skills through expression of Science in creative and meaningful ways.

4.  To develop leadership skills through organisation of Science-related school events.

5.  To have the opportunity for further exposure of Science beyond the school through Science related events and competitions.

## Applied Learning Programme

Singapore is establishing itself as a global hub for food and agri-tech innovation. The long-standing focus on the sustainability of food production has driven the push for innovation (Matt, A\*STAR, 2018). With the society having a higher demand for healthier options and the increasing interest in the use of natural ingredients or nature-identical ingredients in their food products (Jeya, 2014), the “Food Science and Technology” programme offers our students an opportunity to apply their scientific knowledge, skills and block-based coding through app development and micro:bit.

The focus of our ALP is on developing Scientific and digital Literacy i.e. the ability to think, reason and analyse scientifically, use scientific knowledge and processes to both understand the challenges faced by other fast growing economies and participate in decisions and problem solving that affect mankind.  In addition, Critical and Inventive Thinking & Communication, Collaboration and Information Skills are also developed and reinforced when our students exercise sound reasoning and decision making in their scientific investigative study. These are skills and habits of mind that are aligned to the desired 21st century competencies.
