# **LLP**

The Learning for Life Programme (LLP) in CCHY focuses on cultivating values in students through Aesthetics. The programme aims to engage students in Aesthetics events and activities on different level (Exposure, Engagement and Excellence); providing them with real-life experiential learning to develop their character and values, cultivate positive attitudes and encourage self-expression.
