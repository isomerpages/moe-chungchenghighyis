# **Applied Learning Programme**
       
Singapore is establishing itself as a global hub for food and agri-tech innovation. The long-standing focus on the sustainability of food production has driven the push for innovation (_Matt, A\*STAR, 2018_). Singapore is heavily reliant on the world for its food needs, with more than 90 percent of food currently imported. This makes Singapore highly vulnerable to the global and regional imbalances in food supply and demand (_Access Partnership, 2023_). With consumer trending towards safer, healthier food, with a greater focus on sustainability, our Applied Learning Programme (ALP) - contextual theme of “**Health and Food Science**” offers students the opportunities to apply their scientific knowledge, skills, as well as adopt scientific attitudes and mindsets to innovate and push new frontiers, supporting Singapore’s ’30 by 30’ goals of enhancing food security and sustainability.

The foundation module of our ALP focus on enthusing and nurturing our students to be scientifically literate, so that they can make informed decisions and taking responsible decisions in their daily lives. The advanced and accelerated module focus on developing students who have shown deep passion in STEM to innovate in the different aspects of “Health and Food Science” and hence, pursuing STEM for future learning and work.
